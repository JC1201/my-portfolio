        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating dynamic and
          responsive web applications. My journey in software development has
          equipped me with a diverse skill set, including expertise in Python,
          Java, and front-end technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive on challenges and enjoy learning new technologies to enhance
          my projects. My goal is to build software that not only meets user
          needs but also provides an exceptional user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I love exploring new tech trends, contributing to
          open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer
          community.
        </p>
